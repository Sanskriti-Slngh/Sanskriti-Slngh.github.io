        Hey! I’m <strong style="color:#7c3aed;">Sanskriti</strong>, though most people call me
        <strong style="color:#06b6d4;">Tiya</strong> — thanks for stopping by!<br><br>
        I’m endlessly curious about how <strong>technology can change lives</strong>, and I spend most of my time exploring
        the intersection of <strong style="color:#22d3ee;">AI</strong>, <strong style="color:#7c3aed;">healthcare</strong>, and
        <strong style="color:#22d3ee;">sustainability</strong>.
        Over the past few years I’ve built pipelines that turn <em>news into research questions</em>, trained models
        to read <strong>MRIs</strong> and <strong>chest X-rays</strong>, and even dabbled in <strong>water-meter data</strong>
        to track household usage (yes, I’ve asked the question: <em>how many gallons does a shower really take?</em>).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you ever run into me, I’ll probably either be talking about
        <strong>the future of AI in medicine</strong>, sketching ideas for my next side project,
        editing slides way too late at night, choreographing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMG9pweQ4gs" target="_blank" style="color:#7c3aed;">MIT Mirchi</a>,
        or getting way too invested in <strong>sorority shirt designs</strong>.<br><br>
        I’ve <strong>co-founded a club</strong>, <strong>led research at MIT CSAIL</strong>, and
        <strong>presented my work</strong> from IEEE conferences to Boston city halls — but at the heart of it,
        I just love making things that matter.

      <p>
        Now: I’m currently diving deeper into a <strong>disease specialization detection task</strong> that takes raw
        <strong>patient call data</strong> and runs a <strong>symptom extractor model</strong> which then triggers a
        <strong>RAG pipeline</strong> to ask adaptive yes/no questions — narrowing down possible conditions with
        remarkable efficiency.<br>
        I’m conducting this research at <strong style="color:#7c3aed;">MIT CSAIL</strong> under
        <strong>Dr. Amar Gupta</strong> alongside a few brilliant collaborators.

        <strong style="color:#06b6d4;">Currently reading:</strong>
        <em>Mysteries of Cove</em> by Jeffrey Scott Savage, and
        <em>A First Course in Probability</em> by Sheldon Ross.<br>
        <strong style="color:#06b6d4;">Currently listening:</strong>
        <em>Homecoming</em> (“Mandatory,” Season 1 Episode 1) for my podcast class,
        Bollywood on behalf of my dance team, and whatever Spotify thinks I should study to this week.

        I believe in the <strong>art of creating</strong> — whether that’s a machine learning model, a dance,
        or a community project — and in doing it with <strong>joy</strong>, <strong>rigor</strong>,
        and just a little bit of <span style="color:#7c3aed;">chaos</span>.
