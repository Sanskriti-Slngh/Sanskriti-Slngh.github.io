    <p>
      Hey! I’m Sanskriti — thanks for stopping by! I’m endlessly curious about how technology can change lives, and I spend most of my time exploring the intersection of <strong>AI, healthcare, and sustainability</strong>. Over the past few years I’ve built pipelines that turn news into research questions, trained models to read MRIs and chest X-rays, and even dabbled in water-meter data to track household usage (yes, I’ve asked the question: <em>how many gallons does a shower really take?</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      If you ever run into me, I’ll probably either be talking about the future of AI in medicine, sketching ideas for my next side project, editing slides way too late at night, choreographing with Mirchi, or getting way too invested in sorority shirt designs. I’ve co-founded a club, led research at MIT CSAIL, and presented everywhere from IEEE conferences to Boston city halls — but at the heart of it, I just love <strong>making things that matter</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Now:</strong> I’m currently diving deeper into <strong>latent space embeddings for Alzheimer’s MRI data</strong>, building tools that help patients and doctors understand scans faster and better. I’m also spending the summer at WWF, where I get to model the carbon footprint of food systems, and at Kognitos, where I teach LLMs to make error messages a little kinder.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Currently reading:</strong> <em>Mysteries of Cove</em> by Jeffrey Scott Savage, and <em>A First Course in Probability</em> by Sheldon Ross.<br>
      <strong>Currently listening:</strong> Homecoming “Mandatory” (Season 1, Episode 1) for my podcast class, Bollywood on behalf of my dance team, and whatever Spotify thinks I should study listen to that week.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in the art of creating — whether that’s a machine learning model, a dance, or a community project — and in doing it with joy, rigor, and just a little bit of chaos.
